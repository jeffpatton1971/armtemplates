# RSBuild Task Groups

## Overview
A task group is a collection of tasks grouped together to perform an action. You can create them by selecting multiple tasks and choosing to group them. 

Several taskgroups have been created for the rsBuild environments, these are mainly to handle testing the template and parameter files.

### Test AAA Template

### Test Internal LoadBalancer Template

### Test OMS Template

### Test RSV Template

### Test Single VM Template

### Test ARM Template (beta)
This taskgroup is using new testing that should accomodate any resource, but it's not been fully tested out yet.
